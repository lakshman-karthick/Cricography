The informations and statistics of the players has been stored in the hash table for better efficiency and speed.

Here,Hash Table act as a Database.

Then , players has been retrived from hash table and insert them to the heap to find the best performers

The complete list of top performers will be get by heap sort.

Some of the operations of Hash Table like modify and search are implemented in this project.

## Features

- Create Database using Hash Table
- Insert,Delete or Modify Database
